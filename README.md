# pd_plus_gravity_control

This repository contains the code for simulation of pd+gravity control with KUKA iiwa14 in **MATLAB** and **CoppeliaSim**(Vrep).



#### Usage

* run `pdplusgravity.m` in MATLAB first, then `pdplusgravity.ttt` in CoppeliaSim, the simulation will begin
* if you want to stop the simulation, just stop the simulation in CoppeliaSim, after that the MATLAB part will automatically stop
